Numerical Differentiation

What is Numerical differentiation?

Numerical Differentiation is technique to approximate the derivate of a function using numbers instead of exact calculus formulas.

In real-world applications, we often don't have a simple  formula to differentiate(e.g., experimental data or complex equations). Numerical differentiation helps us estimate the slope(rate of change) in such cases.
