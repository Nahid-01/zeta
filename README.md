Numerical Differentiation

What is Numerical Differentiation?

Numerical Differentiation is a method used to approximate the derivative of a function using numerical techniques instead of exact calculus formulas.

In many real-life problems (physics, engineering, computer simulations, machine learning), the exact derivative of a function is either:
Very difficult to calculate, or
Not available in closed form (e.g. experimental data, tabular values).

In those cases, we use numerical methods to estimate the derivative.
